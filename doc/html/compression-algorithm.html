<p>
<b>L</b>empel <b>Z</b>iv <b>R</b>ange <b>E</b>ncoding. <br>
Dictionary lossless compression method, which is based <br>
on another method known as LZ77 or LZSS. <br>
This method has been modified in several directions. <br>
<ul>
<li> Using 4 types of prefixes for different data. </li>
<li> Range encoder to reduce the redundancy of different data types. </li>
<li> Multithreading. </li>
<li> Price table at level 5. </li>
<li> Repeat distances at level 6. </li>
<li> Reduced distances at level 7. </li>
<li> Non greedy parsing at level 8. </li>
<li> Context mixing. </li>
</ul>

<h3 align=center>Algorithm</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
LZRE compression algorithm consist of sliding window and range coder to reduce redundancy.<br>
The sliding window is divided into two parts.
</p>
<table border="1" width="40%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td width="60%">dictionary</td>
<td>look ahead</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
First part is search buffer or dictionary.
Second part is look ahead buffer or lab.
The search buffer stores encoded characters.
The look ahead buffer stores the characters that will be encoded.
The movement takes place from left to right in the text.
Input data sequence often contain matching long substrings.
Idea of sliding window is to replace the duplicate strings with dictionary references,
which can be represented as distance and length of match &lt;distance, length&gt;.
</p>
<h3>Compression algorithm</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Input data sequence save in look ahead buffer.</li>
<li>Search longest match from look ahead buffer in dictionary.</li>
Maximum match length can be in the range [32, 1024].<br>
If non greedy parsing enabled, search is made for several matches from positions 0, 1 in lab.
If length second match is greater than first, litera sent to output stream.
<li>Bitwise writing of codes through range coder to output stream.</li>
<li>Update dictionary.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Uncompression algorithm</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Decode prefix, read litera or match from input compressed stream.</li>
<li>Write decoded string to output stream.</li>
<li>Update dictionary.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This example shows that the decompression algorithm is simpler and faster than compression.
</p>
<h3>Dictionary update</h3>
<p>
Hash four byte prefixes, search in hash table, insert in case of absence.
Hash table item contains self balancing binary search tree for suffixes, also known as a AVL tree.
Suffix is fifth byte after four byte prefix. Tree node contains ring buffer of dictionary distances.
Search suffix in binary tree, insert in case of absence.
Save prefix position to tree node, which is called an <i>distance</i> of dictionary.
This search structure is called a <i>hash chain</i>, which is also used to find matches.
For example, hash string <i>wonderful</i> and find five prefixes.<br>
<ol>
<li><b>wonde</b>rful</li>
<li>w<b>onder</b>ful</li>
<li>wo<b>onderf</b>ul</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Compression example</h3>
<p>
This example shows string encoding from sliding window.<br>
</p>
<table border="1" width="40%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td width="65%">A forester lived in the</td>
<td>&nbspforest</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Word <i>forest</i> from LAB replace by dictionary reference &lt;1, 7&gt;,<br>
Dictionary distance is 1, length of match is 7.<br>
Result we get encoded string<br>
</p>
<table border="1" width="40%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td>A forester lived in the&lt;1, 7&gt;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Instead 30 byte string output 26 byte data sequence.<br>
Which consist of 23 characters by one byte<br>and single dictionary reference by 3 bytes.<br>
Excluding one bit flag before each character.<br>
Message size reduced by 4 byte.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h2 align=center>CM</h2>
<p>
Context Mixing at bit level.<br>
Mixing all context of order n = 1 to N. Maximum order 8.
In order n of context, the next bit is
predicted in the context of the last n - 1 bytes, 
plus the last 0 to 7 bits of the current byte.
Each time a 0 or 1 occurs in some
context, the counts 0 and 1 associated with that context is incremented.
If the opposite count is more than 2, then the excess is halved.
The counts are weighted by n^2.
As a result, we get a total counts 0 and 1
from all contexts of order 1 to N.
This method is easy to implement, provides
good compression, but requires a lot of time.
