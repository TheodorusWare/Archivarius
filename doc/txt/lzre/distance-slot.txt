Distance slot 6 bit

Slot keep two distance msb.
Slot less than 4 not have extra bits.
Implementation from LZMA.

=================
Encoding distance
=================

d : distance from 4
e : distance bits
x : distance extra bits
m : distance next bit after msb

x = e - 2
m = (d >> x) & 1
slot = (x + 1) * 2 + m
encode x

=================
Decoding distance
=================

x = slot / 2 - 1 
m = slot & 1
d = (2 + m) << x
d = d + decode x

========================
Distance encoding scheme
========================

Write distance slot, than distance extra bits.

yyyy : direct bits
xxxx : model bits from msb to lsb

First scheme encoded all extra binary
digits by context model from msb to lsb.

xxxx

Next scheme encoded only low extra binary digits
by context, remaining part is direct binary
digits writed with default probability.

yyyy xxxx

First scheme is better!
